# Netlix_movies_analysis
Given the large number of movies and series available on the Netflix platform i decided to take a dive into their publicly available data and try to answer some questions:
- Movies vs TV Shows
- What are the most frequent Countries that Movies and Tv Shows come from.
- Most Frequent Genres
- Are Movies getting shorter through the years?
